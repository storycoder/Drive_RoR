# Drive Ruby on Rails Course

Welcome to the Drive Course Ruby on Rails course notes page. This repository will store class notes in the Wiki section and any additional programs we will write in when using the Cloud9 development enviroment in class. 

Along with that, I will periodically post links in this README to helpful resources for giving conceptual and hands on insights about what makes Ruby on Rails a great language!

More to come ...
