# Drive Ruby on Rails Course

Welcome to the Drive - Ruby on Rails course notes repository. Please use the soon to be created Wiki to reviews class notes. 

Also look for the code to any programs we create together to be pushed to this particular space. 

Along with that, I will periodically post links in this README to helpful resources for problem solving and that lend conceptual and hands on insights about what makes Ruby on Rails a great language!

Your investment in your learning is important. I encourage you to keep pushing ahead outside of our 1.5 hours per week together. The more you put in, the more you'll gain. Will you have questions? Sure. But you're not alone. I'm here for you and you can also be there for eachother. 

How will we collaborate outside of class? Well, you can talk to eachother as normally do in and out of school. But, ala how programming works in the real world, I've created a private online collaborative space for us to post issues issues we're having with work so that we might be able to help one another. When you're taking a Math Test, looking at someone else's work to help form your answers is cheating. In the world programming, it's not. In fact collaboration is absolutly essential. This space is intended to you a taste how collarboration informs good code. 

Please join the [O'Berry Ruby Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oberryruby) to get started. You'll initially have to request to be added. We'll be able to do so via your school gmail accounts.
