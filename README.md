# Drive Ruby on Rails Course

Welcome to the Drive - Ruby on Rails course notes repository. Please use the soon to be created Wiki to reviews class notes. 

Also look for the code to any programs we create together to be pushed to this particular space. 

Along with that, I will periodically post links in this README to helpful resources for problem solving and that lend conceptual and hands on insights about what makes Ruby on Rails a great language!

More to come ...
